# platformer_game_unity

I spent some time working through a game development tutorial on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) to introduce myself to game development and how to use Unity. After working through some of the tutorials, I decided to test out what I had learnt by creating a platformer game.
I experimented with gravity, movement, collision and trigger detection, animation, screen scrolling, and displaying game information on the screen.

#### Features of the game:
- Player can move right and left, jump and climb ladders.
- Player can collect gems and keys.
- Player loses health when they touch the spikes.
- Player animation changes when walking, jumping and climbing a ladder.
- When player picks up a key, the door of the corresponding colour will disappear or 'unlock.

#### To play:
To play the game on a Mac, clone the repo, and open up the Application named "Platformer Standalone Build". Select the resolution of 2880 x 1800 (should already be selected) and click Play!
